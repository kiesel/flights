flights
========

flights is a hobby project of mine to create a suite of flight tracking tools using an RTL-SDR device (USB) written in Go. It uses the rtlsdr library and provides Go language bindings through CGo.

The rtlsdr library's home is http://sdr.osmocom.org/trac/wiki/rtl-sdr.

This is WIP, not complete and just for fun.
